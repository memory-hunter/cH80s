# cH80s
Simply another CHIP-8 emulator, written in C++ for personal practice and because I love emulators, with sound generation.

## Build
First, clone the repository:

```git@github.com:memory-hunter/cH80s.git```

You need to have [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org).

## Usage

After building the project, simply drag and drop the ROM file so the emulator runs.
